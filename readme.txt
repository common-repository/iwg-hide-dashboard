"Hide Dashboard" hides the dashboard for all users with the capability "hide_dashboard".

== Description ==

This Plugin gives you the possibility to hide the Dashboard before selected users. 
It is very flexible, since it works with an extra capability “Hide Dashboard”. 
This capability can be assigned to one or more roles and/or as an extra capability to one or more users.

Users with hidden Dashboard will be redirected to their profile-page.

You need also the "[Role Manager Plugin](http://www.im-web-gefunden.de/wordpress-plugins/role-manager/ "Role Manager Plugin for WordPress")" for this Plugin.
